            The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces. 
            The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and its professional head is 
            the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred with
            the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honour. 
            The Indian Army originated from the armies of the East India Company, which eventually became the 
            British Indian Army, and the armies of the princely states,which were merged into the national army 
            after independence. The units and regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated
            in a number of battles and campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre honours before 
            and after Independence.

          <h3>Amar Jawan Jyoti</h3>
          <ul>
            
            <li>
                1. Captain Vikram Batra
                Born in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, Captain Vikram Batra of 13 J&K Rifles,
                is known as the hero of the Kargil war. He led one of the toughest war operations in Kashmir,
                and was also called Sher Shah (in the intercepted messages of the Pakistani army).

            </li>

            <li>
               2. Major General Ian Cardozo
               Major General Ian Cardozo, who has many achievements to his name, will always be known for his
                cimmense courage in the 1971 war with Pakistan. He was, at the time, a young major with 5 Gorkha Rifles. During the war, he stepped on a landmine and severely injured his leg. When even the doctor could not cut his leg,
               Cardozo asked for a khukri (the Gorkha knife) and cut his own leg off, saying,
               “Now go and bury it!”

            </li>
            <li>
                3. Brigadier Mohammad Usman
                Born in Bibipur, Uttar Pradesh, this man of steel joined the Indian army in 1934. 
                During the Indo-Pakistan war of 1947/48, Brigadier Usman repulsed a fierce attack on Naushera and Jhangar, two highly strategic locations in Jammu and Kashmir,
                and was named by his fellow soldiers ‘The Lion of Naushera.’
            </li>
            <li>
                4 . Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav

            <li>
              5.  Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat

             combat when they were airlifted to Srinagar on October 30, 1947 to fight Pakistani invaders.
            </li>
